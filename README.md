# go-cms-techblog â˜• ðŸ¤­ Cafe y Chisme â˜• ðŸ¤­

## Description
Welcome to Cafe y Chisme! This is a CMS techblog where users can come and share their thoughts, comments, and anything related coding. 

ðŸ‘¾ Motivation: We aim to curate a diverse range of blogs primarily utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars and Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.. Its a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

ðŸ‘¾ Project Purpose: Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

ðŸ‘¾ Lessons Learned: Through these endeavors, I'm gaining a solid grasp of fundamental coding languages.
